* IR
IR is a library for parsing and generating NEC IR remote control signals.

Process the IR signal by calculating the time, in microseconds, between
each rising/falling and falling/rising edge in the signal (pulses in the
example below).  If put() returns true, then a full packet has been received.
#+begin_src zig
  var nec = ir.NEC{};
  for (pulses, 0..) |_, i| {
    	if (nec.put(pulses[i])) {
    		break;
    	}
  }
  const msg = try nec.value();
  std.log.debug("address: 0x{x}, command: 0x{x}", .{msg.address, msg.command});
#+end_src

Generate an IR signal:
#+begin_src zig
  var nec = ir.NEC{ .tolerance = 0 };
  var pulses: [66]u32 = undefined;
  nec.get(message{ .address = 0x16, .command = 0x04 }, &pulses);
#+end_src

Now you should be able to iterate over the pulses and toggle an IR LED
for the amount of time defined by the pulse (time in milliseconds).
