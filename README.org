* IR
IR is a library for parsing IR remote control signals.
** NEC
Process the IR signal by calculating the time, in milliseconds, between
each rising and falling (or falling and rising) edge in the signal.  If
put() returns true, then a full packet has been received.
#+begin_src go
  var parser = ir.IR{};
  if (parser.put(t)) {
  	// a full NEC packet has been received
  	const msg = try parser.value();
  	std.log.debug("address: 0x{x}, command: 0x{x}", .{msg.address, msg.command});
  }
